Task:

Create a sql db from adult dataset and name it sqladb

Solution:

import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from pandas import DataFrame, Series
import sqlite3 as db

from pandasql import sqldf
import sqlite3
db = sqlite3.connect("sqladb")
cur = db.cursor()

sql = "CREATE TABLE adultTable (age INTEGER, workclass VARCHAR(255), fnlwgt INTEGER, education VARCHAR(255), education_num INTEGER, marital_status VARCHAR(255), occupation VARCHAR(255), relationship VARCHAR(255), race VARCHAR(255), sex VARCHAR(255), capital_gain INTEGER, capital_loss INTEGER, hours_per_week INTEGER, native_country VARCHAR(255), moreThan50K VARCHAR(255));"
cur.execute(sql)

table_data = csv.reader(file('sample.csv'))
for row in table_data:
  cur.execute('INSERT INTO adultTable VALUES("%s", "%s", "%s", "%s", "%s", "%s", "%s", "%s", "%s", "%s", "%s", "%s", "%s", "%s", "%s"))
db.commit()

1. Select 10 records from the adult sqladb

Solution:

cur.execute("SELECT * FROM adultTable LIMIT 10")
myresult = cur.fetchall()
for x in myresult:
    print(x)
    
2. Show me the average hours per week of all men who are working in private sector

Solution:

cur.execute("SELECT AVG(hours_per_week) average_hours_per_week FROM adultTable WHERE workclass = 'Private'")
myresult = cur.fetchall()
for x in myresult:
    print(x)
    
3. Show me the frequency table for education, occupation and relationship, separately

Solution:

  a. Eduction:
     cur.execute("SELECT education , COUNT(education) frequency FROM adultTable GROUP BY education")
     myresult = cur.fetchall()
     for x in myresult:
        print(x)
        
  b. Occupation:
     cur.execute("SELECT occupation, COUNT(occupation) frequency FROM adultTable GROUP BY occupation")
     myresult = cur.fetchall()
     for x in myresult:
        print(x)
      
  c. Relationship
     cur.execute("SELECT relationship, COUNT(relationship) frequency FROM adultTable GROUP BY relationship ")
     myresult = cur.fetchall()
     for x in myresult:
        print(x)
      
4. Are there any people who are married, working in private sector and having a masters degree

Solution:

cur.execute("SELECT IF(count > 0, 'Yes', 'No') exist FROM ( SELECT COUNT(marital_status) count FROM adultTable WHERE marital_status IN ('Married_civ_spouse', 'Married_spouse_absent' , 'Married_AF_spouse')) alias ")
myresult = cur.fetchall()
for x in myresult:
    print(x)
    
5. What is the average, minimum and maximum age group for people working in different sectors

Solution:

cur.execute("SELECT workclass as sector, AVG(age) averageAge, MIN(age) minAge, MAX(age) maxAge  FROM adultTable GROUP BY workclass")
myresult = cur.fetchall()
for x in myresult:
  print(x)
